## How to import this code to the Makecode editor for microbit
In the Makecode editor, click the House (home) icon, then click ## Import. Click **Import URL**. In the URL space, paste this: **https://github.com/paynor/hoverbit-v2_bluetooth-ble**.
The extension required will also be imported automatically.

## Extension needed if you want to use the makecode hoverbit blocks in a different project, using bluetooth rather than radio for control.
To use this Makecode in a hoverbit project for microbit other than this one (hoverbit-v2_bluetooth-ble), you will need to add a specific **extension** in MakeCode.

* open [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
* click on **New Project**
* click on **Extensions** under the gearwheel menu
* search for **https://github.com/paynor/Hoverbit_V2-fork_bluetooth-test** and import.
  
**Note:** this extension is a fork of the original gomakekit extension for the hoverbit_v2 - with radio removed and bluetooth added.
The orginal extension (not compatible with bluetooth) is here: https://github.com/gomakekit/Hoverbit_V2/tree/master
